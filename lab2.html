        <p>    One day there was a little grasshopper that did not know how to hop. He tried and tried to hop but was not able to hop. Instead the little grasshopper had a special talent he did not know about yet. The little grasshopper became very sad and did not know what he was going to do if he couldn't hop. He was made fun of by all the other grasshoppers while he was playing but that did not last long.  </p>
         <p> The little grasshopper was so special, while he was not able to hop he was able to make people very happy! He was very good at telling jokes and making all the other animals and even humans laugh! Soon this little grasshopper was so happy agian. News spread very fast about this very special grasshopper. The queen of the grasshopper village received news of this special grasshopper and she wanted to hear a joke from the very special grasshopper.  When the grasshopper told the queen a joke she laughed so hard and made the little grasshopper the jester. This little grasshopper is now one of the most praised grasshoppers and all of the grasshoppers. </p>
